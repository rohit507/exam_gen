# Data Chaining

This is a set of utility functions and a superclass to allowing distribution
and collection of data through a nested object of some sort.

This is for doing things like:
  - Assigning problem numbers
  - Gather Score Information
  - Providing Stable Random Seeds

And a bunch of other really common tasks that will happen repeatedly in
processing.
