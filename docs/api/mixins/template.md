# Template

Goal is to provide basic flow to using jinja templates w/ good error messages
for the assorted users.

  - Setting:
      - Template File
  - Add variables:
      - For rendering template
  - Render template in various formats
      - Things like: DEFAULT, SOLUTIONS, ANSWERED, GRADED, etc...
      - Capture large scale

Yeah ok, can't do anything clever with blocks really. Need to pass context
down and pass rendered content up.
