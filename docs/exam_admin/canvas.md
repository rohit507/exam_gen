# Administering Exams Through Canvas


  - Quiz Options:
    - Shuffle Answers: false
    - Time Limit: as needed
    - Allow Multiple Attempts: probably true
    - Let students see responses: probably false


  - Notes for Students:
    - File submissions *must* be reuploaded with every submission.
    - Grades shown by canvas are meaningless, ignore them. Actual grades will be
      calculated after the fact.
    - Points associated w/ each question on canvas are meaningless, refer to
      exam for scoring if any.
    - *If resubmit*: You can leave a non-file-upload question unanswered on a
      submission and the system will just use the last submitted answer.


  - Notes for Exam Creator:
    - Put problem name and number (or other identifer) in the problem text,
      the title you set (next to problem type dropdown) is invisible to students
      and exports.
    - Set problem pts to 0
    - Mark all answers as correct.
    - Don't use formula questions, they're broken.
    - Numberical question, set the accepted range super wide


  - Getting Grades:
    - Files: quiz page "download all files"
    - Grades: quiz page -> "quiz statistics" -> "Student analysis"
