# Exams / Assignments

The exam or assignment is the root of any project that uses `exam_gen`.
It serves a number of purposes:

  - Point to stored information about class rosters and students who will
    take the exam.
  - Point to questions that will be included as part of the exam.
  - Determine how to render the exam as a single document.
  - Act as a command line executable for building and interacting with the exam.
